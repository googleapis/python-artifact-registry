Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library within a Python virtual environment using the `venv`_ module. `venv`_ is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem this addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With `venv`_, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

.. _`venv`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
